Project Competition Submission – Apology & Reflection
🚀 My First Coding Challenge Experience
Hi everyone,

First of all, I want to sincerely apologize if my project feels incomplete, messy, or even frustrating to review. This was my first-ever attempt at building a project like this, and I underestimated the difficulty of working under a strict deadline.

🤖 Learning with AI Assistance
I had zero experience in full-stack development before this, and I relied heavily on AI (ChatGPT) to guide me through every step. It was both an exciting and overwhelming experience—learning Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and Git all at once while racing against time.

🎯 Why I Took This Challenge
I decided to compete not because I was ready, but because I wanted the experience of what it's like to be a real developer—facing deadlines, solving problems, and dealing with frustration when things don’t work. I wanted to feel the real struggle that programmers go through, something I couldn’t get from an internship or an entry-level job without experience.

⚡ What I Learned
Coding under pressure is tough but rewarding
Debugging and fixing errors takes way more time than expected
Understanding how different technologies connect (frontend, backend, database) is essential
Asking for help (from AI or others) is not a weakness but a necessity
🙏 Apologies & Thanks
If my project is annoying to review or feels incomplete, I truly apologize. But I hope you can see my passion and my willingness to learn. This challenge has motivated me even more to improve my skills and become a better developer.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I appreciate any feedback! 🚀
